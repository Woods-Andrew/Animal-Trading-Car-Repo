			<p>Tigers are large cats with a coat of dusty orange, with striking black stripes.
				They can grow to be 8.2-13 feet, and can live up to 10-15 years. They are hardly seen despite their size, since they
				stalk around the forest quietly. Like lions, they are an endangered species of big cats because humans are
				destryoing the forests that they live in.</p>
